## Installation

This bot requires an existing database and db user before installation, with those credentials provided it will just import the initial schema itself

Either make a new database and db user for the bot on the panel machine, using the [MySQL Setup Guide](https://pterodactyl.io/tutorials/mysql_setup.html), or make one in an instance of the [mariadb egg](https://github.com/Ptero-Eggs/application-eggs/tree/main/database/sql/mariadb).
